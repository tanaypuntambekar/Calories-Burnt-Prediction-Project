# Calories-Burnt-Prediction-Project

- The objective of the calories burnt prediction machine learning project is to develop a model that accurately estimates the number of calories burned by an individual during physical activity. This model can be beneficial for individuals who want to track their calorie expenditure to achieve fitness goals, optimize their exercise routines, or monitor their overall health and wellness.
- Python Libraries used for the Project :
  Pandas , Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Machine Learning Algorithms used :
  Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression
- Deployment :
  Created a simple Graphical user interface that takes Gender, Age, Height, Weight, Body temperature, Heart rate as input and provides calories burnt as output.
